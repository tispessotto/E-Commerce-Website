# E-Commerce-Website
With this code I want to showcase my skills in Python, HTML, Database and management of users and their password.\
In this website you can select the products from the database and buy them thanks to its integration with a Stripe platform.\
All the credit card sensitive information will be handled by their side.\
No shopping can be done until the user is logged in. If one tries to buy without logging in they will then be redirect to the registering route.\
User password is encrypted and only the hashed version is stored in the database.\
